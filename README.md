# ruby_rpg
Instructions:

To run the game, ensure you are in the root directory of the game, and use "ruby ./lib/runner.rb".

Commands are mostly input as a verb followed by a noun, unless the game states otherwise (e.g. punch tree). The game will inform you if you are missing a type of word.

So far, there are only 2 scenarios beyond character creation.

Known issues:

  verbs and nouns cannot be 2 words long e.g. "pick up grass" is not a valid command, as "pick up" is 2 words
  
  Dictionary is not complete, so many verbs may give an "expected verb next" error
