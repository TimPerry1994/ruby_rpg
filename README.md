# ruby_rpg
Instructions:

To run the game, ensure you are in the root directory of the game, and use "ruby ./lib/runner.rb".

Commands are mostly input as a verb followed by a noun, unless the game states otherwise (e.g. punch tree). The game will inform you if you are missing a type of word.

So far, there are only 2 scenarios beyond character creation.
